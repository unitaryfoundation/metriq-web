        <h2 className='text-center'>Open Quantum Benchmark Committee</h2>
        <div className='text-start'>
          <p>The quantum computing landscape is rapidly evolving, with breakthroughs and advancements occurring regularly. However, amidst this progress, one challenge persists: how can researchers, developers, and enthusiasts effectively benchmark and compare different quantum computing platforms and technologies? To address this challenge head-on, Unitary Foundation has established the Open Quantum Benchmark Committee. This committee will play a crucial role in furthering the development and adoption of quantum benchmarks to provide the community with a comprehensive and reliable framework for evaluating quantum computing systems.</p>
          <p>The motivation behind the Open Quantum Benchmark Committee stems from the need to foster collaboration and standardization within the quantum computing community. By bringing together experts from various domains, including applications, compilers, error correction, hardware, and simulators, we aim to increase the size and improve the quality of the taxonomy captured by Metriq, our community-driven quantum benchmarks platform, and empower researchers and developers with the tools they need to navigate the complex landscape of quantum computing benchmarks.</p>

            AJ Rasmusson is a graduate student at Indiana University doing trapped-ion research under Phil Richerme. This Summer, he’ll start a postdoc at the NIST Ion Storage Group, doing more ion trap experiments. In high school, his grandpa gifted him an audio lecture on quantum physics, and he’s been hooked ever since. He enjoys—and has greatly benefited from—open science endeavors, and he believe this philosophy is important for a vibrant scientific community. Outside of work, he enjoys wrangling his three kids, eating delicious food, 3D printing, and wandering the great outdoors.
