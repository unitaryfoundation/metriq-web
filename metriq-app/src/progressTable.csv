A large class of scientifically interesting materials, from high-$T_c$ superconductors to spin liquids, involve medium to strong correlations, and building a holistic understanding of these materials is critical. Doing so is hindered by the competition between the kinetic energy and Coulomb repulsion, which renders both analytic and numerical methods unsatisfactory for describing interacting materials. Fault-tolerant quantum computers have been proposed as a path forward to overcome these difficulties, but this potential capability has not yet been fully assessed. Here, using the multi-orbital Fermi-Hubbard model as a representative model and a source of scalable problem specifications, we estimate the resource costs needed to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for obtaining experimentally relevant quantities such as correlation function estimation.

We estimate quantum computer resources that will be required for performing calculations on quantum computers with chemical accuracy for several types of molecules. In particular, we directly compare the resources and timings associated with classical and quantum computers for the molecules H$_2$ for increasing basis set sizes, and Cr$_2$ for a variety of complete active spaces (CAS) within the scope of the CASCI and CASSCF methods. The results obtained for the chromium dimer enable us to estimate the size of the active space at which computations of non-dynamic correlation on a quantum computer should take less time than analogous computations on a classical computer. Using this result, we speculate on the types of chemical applications for which the use of quantum computers would be both beneficial and relevant to industrial applications in the short term.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12472,"",,2024-02-07 00:08:11.373+00,2024-02-07 00:08:11.373+00,19,,2024-02-07 00:08:11.373+00,"","",139,Quantum computational chemistry (QCC),Quantum computational chemistry (QCC),the use of quantum computers to solve problems in computational quantum chemistry.,2022-07-14 12:21:27.924+00,2022-07-14 12:21:27.924+00,39,58,f,How will quantum computers provide an industrially relevant computational advantage in quantum chemistry?,752,Quantum computational chemistry (QCC)

By invoking these circuits as oracles within the recently introduced ""qubitization"" framework, one can use quantum phase estimation to sample states in the Hamiltonian eigenbasis with optimal query complexity $O(λ/ ε)$ where $λ$ is an absolute sum of Hamiltonian coefficients and $ε$ is target precision. For both the Hubbard model and electronic structure Hamiltonian in a second quantized basis diagonalizing the Coulomb operator, our circuits have T gate complexity $O({N + \log (1/ε}))$ where $N$ is number of orbitals in the basis. This enables sampling in the eigenbasis of electronic structure Hamiltonians with T complexity $O(N^3 /ε+ N^2 \log(1/ε)/ε)$. Compared to prior approaches, our algorithms are asymptotically more efficient in gate complexity and require fewer T gates near the classically intractable regime.
